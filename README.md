Welcome to the FIFE tutorials package.  Please find the following tutorials in
this package:

* tutorial1a - Initializing FIFE
* tutorial1b - Loading and displaying a map
* tutorial1c - Interacting with the map
* tutorial1d - Adding a simple dialog box

All source code has quite detailed comments.  Each tutorial builds on the 
previous ones.  Begin by looking at the `run.py` files in their respective 
directories.  That is the base starting point.

To run these tutorials drop to a command prompt and change directory to the 
tutorial directory you are working in and type: `python run.py`
